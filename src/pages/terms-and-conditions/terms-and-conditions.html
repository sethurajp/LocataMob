we may change these Terms at any time without prior notice. The revised Terms will become

The information may not always be accurate. We try to make sure that the latitude, longitude

any malicious activities on the App, the admin can exit the user without giving any
information. Accordingly, we and our data providers do not accept any liability for any error
or omission in the information available or the recommendations made through the App and
exclude all liability for any action you may take or loss or injury you may suffer (direct or
indirect including loss of income, profit, opportunity or time) as a result of relying on any
information available through the App.
